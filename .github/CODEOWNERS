# CODEOWNERS - Security Protection for Repository
#
# This file defines code ownership rules to prevent unauthorized changes
# to critical repository infrastructure and GitHub Actions workflows.
#
# Security rationale:
# - GitHub Actions workflows can execute arbitrary code and access secrets
# - Malicious workflow modifications could compromise the repository
# - CODEOWNERS ensures admin review for sensitive file changes
#
# Required reviews: All specified files require @cynthiateeters approval

# Protect entire .github directory (workflows, templates, configs)
.github/ @cynthiateeters

# Protect all workflow files anywhere in repository
*.yml @cynthiateeters
*.yaml @cynthiateeters

# Protect this CODEOWNERS file itself from unauthorized modification
.github/CODEOWNERS @cynthiateeters

# Protect package management and dependencies
package.json @cynthiateeters           # npm scripts can execute arbitrary code
package-lock.json @cynthiateeters      # dependency lock prevents supply chain attacks
.npmrc @cynthiateeters                 # npm configuration controls registry access
*.npmrc @cynthiateeters                # npm config files anywhere in repo

# Protect executable scripts and configurations
*.sh @cynthiateeters                   # shell scripts have system access and execution rights
scripts/ @cynthiateeters               # script directory contains validation and automation
Dockerfile @cynthiateeters             # container definitions control execution environment
docker-compose.yml @cynthiateeters     # orchestration files define service configurations
docker-compose.yaml @cynthiateeters    # alternate docker compose file format

# Protect validation and testing infrastructure
validation/ @cynthiateeters            # validation logic controls quality gates
jest.config.* @cynthiateeters          # test configuration can execute setup/teardown code
.eslintrc* @cynthiateeters             # linting rules can include executable configurations

# Note: This protection applies to pull requests but not direct pushes to main
# Repository branch protection rules should also be configured to require
# pull request reviews for the main branch
