# CSS :has() Selector: The Parent Selector and Relationship Queries

The :has() pseudo-class, often called the "parent selector," revolutionizes CSS by selecting elements based on their descendants or subsequent siblings. It enables upward and lateral selection in the DOM treeâ€”previously impossible without JavaScript. An element matches :has() if any of its descendants match the selector argument.

Beyond parent selection, :has() enables powerful relational queries: select a form that contains an invalid input, a nav containing an active link, or a grid that holds a specific number of items. It's a game-changer for responsive components and state-based styling.

## Example

```css
/* Parent selection: Style form with invalid input */
form:has(input:invalid) {
  border: 2px solid red;
  padding: 1rem;
  background: #fff5f5;
}

/* Sibling selection: Label for checked checkbox */
label:has(+ input:checked) {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #0066cc;
}

/* Quantity queries: Different grid for 4+ items */
.gallery:has(> :nth-child(4)) {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
}

/* Component state: Card with hover on button */
.card:has(.button:hover) {
  box-shadow: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}
```

## When to Use

Use :has() for parent/ancestor selection, conditional layouts, form validation styling, and reducing JavaScript dependency. Check browser support (Safari 15.4+, Chrome/Edge 105+, Firefox 121+).
