# Modern CSS Selectors: :is(), :where(), and :not() for Efficient Selection

Modern functional pseudo-classes dramatically reduce selector repetition and improve maintainability. **:is()** accepts a selector list and matches any element that matches any selector in that list, maintaining the highest specificity of its arguments. **:where()** works identically but always has zero specificity, perfect for creating easily overridable defaults. **:not()** selects elements that don't match its argument, now accepting complex selector lists.

These selectors are forgivingâ€”if one selector in the list is invalid, others still work (unlike traditional selector lists where one invalid selector breaks the entire rule). This makes them ideal for progressive enhancement.

## Example

```css
/* :is() - Reduces repetition, takes highest specificity */
:is(header, main, footer) h2 {
  color: navy;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}

/* :where() - Zero specificity for easy overrides */
:where(input, textarea, select) {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 8px;
}

/* :not() - Exclude specific elements */
.card:not(:last-child) {
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

/* Complex example */
article :is(h1, h2, h3):not(:first-child) {
  margin-top: 2em;
}
```

## When to Use

Use :is() for DRY CSS, :where() for low-specificity defaults in design systems, and :not() for exceptions. All have excellent browser support (2021+).
